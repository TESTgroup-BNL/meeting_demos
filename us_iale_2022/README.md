# Google Earth Engine and clould compute mutliscale remote sensing demos 

### Focus
A series of demo workflows illustrating how to leverage cloud storage buckets (e.g. google S3), Jupyterlab, Google Earth Engine, and cloud compute (Google Collab or Binder) to integrate novel UAS and other remote sensing data for multiscale analyses in the Arctic
